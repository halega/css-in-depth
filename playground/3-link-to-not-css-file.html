    <!-- This attribute is used to define the
         type of the content linked to. The
         value of the attribute should be 
         a MIME type such as text/html, text/css,
         and so on. The common use of this
         attribute is to define the type of
         stylesheet being referenced (such as text/css), 
         but given that CSS is the only
         stylesheet language used on the web,
         not only is it possible to omit the
         type attribute, but is actually
         now recommended practice. -->
