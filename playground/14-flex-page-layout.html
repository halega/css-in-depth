				<h1>Abstract data type</h1>
				<p>In computer science, an abstract data type (ADT) is a mathematical model for
					data types. An abstract data type is defined by its behavior (semantics)
					from the point of view of a user, of the data, specifically in terms of possible values, possible
					operations on data of this type, and the behavior of these operations. This mathematical model
					contrasts with data structures, which are concrete representations of data, and are the point of
					view of an implementer, not a user.</p>
				<p>Formally, an ADT may be defined as a "class of objects whose logical behavior is defined by a set of
					values and a set of operations";[1] this is analogous to an algebraic structure in mathematics. What
					is meant by "behaviour" varies by author, with the two main types of formal specifications for
					behavior being axiomatic (algebraic) specification and an abstract model;[2] these correspond to
					axiomatic semantics and operational semantics of an abstract machine, respectively. Some authors
					also include the computational complexity ("cost"), both in terms of time (for computing operations)
					and space (for representing values). In practice, many common data types are not ADTs, as the
					abstraction is not perfect, and users must be aware of issues like arithmetic overflow that are due
					to the representation. For example, integers are often stored as fixed-width values (32-bit or
					64-bit binary numbers), and thus experience integer overflow if the maximum value is exceeded.</p>
